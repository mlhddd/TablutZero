# TablutZero

TablutZero is a machine learning project that utilizes the AlphaZero algorithm to master the Nordic traditional board game, Tablut. This project combines reinforcement learning with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and deep neural networks to create an AI capable of self-play and strategy optimization.

## Features

- **Reinforcement Learning**: Self-play learning using the AlphaZero framework.
- **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**: Integrates neural networks to optimize decision-making in the search tree.
- **Neural Networks**: Employs convolutional and residual networks to analyze board states and predict moves.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install required Python libraries:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/tablutzero.git
